# Weather Forecast App

## Description

A weather App designed to state the weather designed to help the normal traveller in their journey throughout the day as follows:

- The motivation for building this app came from the need of planning ahead a travelling day.
- The project, however still in progress, was built to help with the crucial information that any traveller might need whilst travelling.
- It offers information about the weather thus solving the issue of the unknown
- Throughout the creation of this project I have learned that the weather is in constant change and always unpredictable. That is why you always have to be prepared when using the moment.js and json to find out the data and fetch it from the specific API.
